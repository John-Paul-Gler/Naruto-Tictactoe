# Naruto-Tictactoe
John Paul M. Gler, a Computer Engineering student from National University Fairview, created this game.
The game is a simple tic-tac-toe with a twist in which the players must form 3 lines to win.
This game has a theme from the anime "Naruto" and the symbols were replaced with the crests of the Uzumaki
and Uchiha clans. To form a line the player must align three similar symbols either horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally.  As stated earlier the symbols might have changed from the traditional X and O the rules 
stayed the same. Also keep in mind that the game might not run on other pcs because there are files that can 
only be found on my computer although those files are only the images and aside from that it can run on any other
computers.
