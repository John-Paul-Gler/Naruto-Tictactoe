# Naruto-Tictactoe
John Paul M. Gler, a Computer Engineering student from National University Fairview, created this game.
The game is a simple tic-tac-toe with a twist in which the players must form 3 lines to win.
This game has a theme from the anime "Naruto" and the symbols were replaced with the crests of the Uzumaki
and Uchiha clans. To form a line the player must align three similar symbols either horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally.  As stated earlier the symbols might have changed from the traditional X and O the rules 
stayed the same.
