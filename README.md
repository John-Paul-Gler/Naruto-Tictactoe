# Naruto-Tictactoe
John Paul M. Gler, a Computer Engineering student from National University Fairview, created this game.
The game is a simple tic-tac-toe with a twist in which the players must form 3 lines to win.
This game has a theme from the anime "Naruto" and the symbols were replaced with the crests of the Uzumaki
and Uchiha clans. To form a line the player must align three similar symbols horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally.  As stated earlier the symbols might have changed from the traditional X and O the rules 
stayed the same. Also, remember that the game might not run on other pcs because there are files that can
only be found on my computer although those files are only the images and it can run on any other
computer.

First, the players need to load up the game

then we get to playing

the players will decide if they want to be with the Uzumaki clan or the Uchiha clan

after choosing their side they need to fight to get three lines to win
